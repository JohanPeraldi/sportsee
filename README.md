# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Since this project needs a backend API to run, if the backend uses port 3000, this app will not be able to run on that port.
It will therefore offer an alternative port, such as port 3001. In that case, just type `y` when prompted and project will open in a new window. If not, open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Tools needed

The following tools are necessary to run this project:

- Node.js (this project was created using `Node.js version 16.14.2`);
- NPM (installed with Node.js);
- All dependencies listed in the package.json file (just run `npm install` after cloning the project).
